# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis
AutosRUs’ newest prototype, the MechaCar, is suffering from production troubles that are blocking the manufacturing team’s progress. AutosRUs’ upper management has called on the data analytics team to review the production data for insights that may help the manufacturing team.


## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

<img width="864" alt="Screen Shot 2022-02-19 at 3 14 38 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/93164021/154817553-ae7a6af5-948c-46f1-af4e-03218e7803c4.png">

- Keeping in mind, a significance level of 5%, the variables 'vehicle_length' and 'ground_clearance' possessed p-values of less than 0.05 which reflects the significance of the variables on the mpg. These should therefore be controlled for in the production of the vehicle.

- If there is a significant linear relationship between the independent variable X and the dependent variable Y, the slope will not equal zero. The null hypothesis states that the slope is equal to zero, and the alternative hypothesis states that the slope is not equal to zero. In this case, the two variables are significant and therefore the slope will not be equal to zero.

- The p-value of the regression model is at 0.00009, which portrays the significance of the model and that the linear model predicts mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively.
